    <p class="instructions__content">Ryan has baked you the most delicious cake you could ever imagine tasting, but before you eat it, you must figure out how to blow all the candles out.  There are seven candles in a circle, each representing, uhhh, 4.428571428571429 years of your life. The goal is to blow out all of the candles, ideally in the least number of moves.</p>
    <p class="instructions__content">When you blow out one candle in the circle, the two adjacent candles are extinguished as well. If you blow on a candle that has already been extinguished, it will relight. And if there is an extinguished candle next to the one you blow on, it also will relight.</p>
    <p class="instructions__content">To put it another way: When you blow on a candle, itâ€”as well as the candles on either sideâ€”will change from lit to unlit, or vice versa.</p>
